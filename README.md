# 🎓 Hacettepe Community Event Portal (Web-GIS)

A full-stack Web-GIS application designed for student communities at Hacettepe University Beytepe Campus to manage spatial event data, fully compliant with the **GMT 458** final assignment criteria.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
Developed between **January 12-16, 2026**, this project focuses on managing heterogeneous spatial data in a NoSQL environment with role-based access control and full CRUD capabilities on a geographical point layer.

## 📸 Procedures & Implementation Details

### 1. User Authentication & Verification
The portal uses a secure authentication flow. Users register with Hacettepe credentials and must verify their account using a 6-digit OTP code sent via the system.

### 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
The system supports three distinct user types managed in a NoSQL backend. Permissions are dynamically adjusted: Students can only view, while Admins/Leaders can manage data.
* **STUDENT:** View-only access.
* **ADMIN/LEADER:** Full management rights.

### 3. Spatial Data Infrastructure (GIS CRUD)
Admins can interactively add event locations on the campus map using a modern UI modal. Data is stored as GeoJSON features in MongoDB.
* **Automated Logic:** If an image URL is not provided, the system defaults to the community-specific logo.
  
* **Create (C):** Authorized users can click any location on the map. A modern modal window appears, allowing the user to enter the event name and an optional image URL. Upon saving, the coordinates (latitude/longitude) are captured and stored in the NoSQL database.
* **Read (R):** The system fetches all spatial features from MongoDB and renders them as interactive markers on the map. Additionally, a dynamic sidebar (event grid) lists these events with their respective community logos.
* **Update (U):** The "Edit" (Düzenle) feature allows Admins to modify the attributes of an existing spatial point, such as renaming the event, without changing its geographical location.
* **Delete (D):** Redundant or incorrect spatial features can be removed from the system permanently using the "Delete" (Sil) button, which triggers a DELETE request to the FastAPI backend.

### 4. API Development & Validation
The backend API exposes spatial and non-spatial resources, fully documented via **Swagger UI** and rigorously tested using **Postman** for all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

* **Interactive API Documentation:** Once the backend server is running, you can access the full Swagger UI here:

### 5. Performance Monitoring & Stress Testing
To observe the impact of indexing and system stability, performance tests were conducted. We monitored response times under various load conditions to ensure the FastAPI backend remains resilient.
* **Indexing:** Implementation of `2dsphere` index reduced spatial query latency.
* **Stress Test:** Monitored variation in response times under concurrent user simulation.

### 6. Deployment & Future Work (AWS)
* **Live Backend API (Swagger UI):** [http://13.60.21.222:8000/docs](http://13.60.21.222:8000/docs)
* **Infrastructure:** Hosted on **AWS EC2** (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS).
* **Database:** MongoDB Atlas (Cloud).
  
While the cloud infrastructure and AWS EC2 instance configurations have been successfully established, the project is currently running in a local environment for final stability checks and has not yet been mapped to a public DNS for live access.
